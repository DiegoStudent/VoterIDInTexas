        <h1>Voter ID</h1>
        <p>Voting is a fundemental part of being an American. Voting is an opportunity for you to voice your opinion in the most legitimate way possible, a government system that takes everyone’s opinions into account and improves the lives of most with the opinion of the majority. Although voting is important, it is not a right like many people would think. There have been amendments for voting rights for women, African Americans, and people from the ages of 18-21 but technically there is no universal suffrage. Voting, therefore, is a privilege that is allowed at the discretion of the government.</p>
        <p>Some have said that voter ID is predicated on racism, considering its similarity to the poll tax in a society where we have to pay for almost every form of government documents. Some on the right say that Voter ID is required to uphold a fair democracy and that unless someone can provide a form of identification proving that they are a citizen, they may cast illegitimate votes. Another interesting aspect that will be explored is the idea, that so many on the left hold regarding this issue, that due to various factors minorities have a harder time getting any form of identification.</p>
        <p>Many will say that everyone should have some kind of ID. A valid form of ID is required for opening a bank account, as well as applying for SNAP benefits and Social Security<a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib6">(Schow)</a>. If you are a contributing member of society, you have to receive income from your contributions somehow, and usually that is through a bank account. Some on the left will say that Voter ID is racist since minority inner city groups tend to be the most effected. The cost for an ID in Texas, which is generally required to receive any kind of service needed for day-to-day life, <a href="https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/driver-license-fees" class="in-text-citation">can range from 16 to 33 dollars</a>. millions of potential voters “live more than 10 miles from their nearest state ID-issuing office open more than two days a week”<a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib1">(Gaskins)</a> and many are in rural areas. Many of the people that don’t have any form of ID are college students, elderly people and people in rural areas that don’t have access to transportation.<a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib1">(Gaskins)</a></p>
