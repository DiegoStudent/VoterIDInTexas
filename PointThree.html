        <h1>The Right on Voter ID</h1>
        <p>One of the biggest arguments for voter ID, from the right, is that it helps to prevent voter fraud. One counter to this main point is that there have been too few cases of voter fraud for the benefit of voter ID not to be negligible. Despite this, one counter argument to that counter argument is that, as with most crime, its likely that the majority of people that commit voter fraud don’t get caught making the statistics show far less than what is reality. Furthermore, it could be argued that in a system that relies so heavily on the integrity of voting, one fraudulent vote is one too many. There have been 66 reported cases of voter fraud where charges have been pursued from 2004 to 2014. According to <a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib5">Matthew Rousu</a>, a writer for Forbes and professor at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania, this would mean that there is likely at least 6,600 cases that went unreported in that time.<a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib5">(Rousu)</a></p>
        <p>In a study conducted by the <a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib4">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> over a period of ten years it was found that when voter ID laws were enacted, the turn out levels in states that implemented them were different but the turn out trends were not. The same study also found that voter ID laws had little to no effect on voter turnout for any particular demographic. The study also suggests that previous studies on the issue may have incorrect information due to a variety of factors. One of the factors being that previous studies have gotten information from people themselves while this study collected data from “administrative records of individual registration and turnout”.  Another thing this study does differently is count people that are registered to vote as well as people that are not registered. <a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib4">(Cantoni)</a></p>
        <p>There is also an idea that arguments against the implementation of voter ID are racist. To suggest that minorities are less likely to obtain a form of ID because they cant or don’t know how can be seen as a soft bigotry of low expectations. This relevant, though admittedly biased, YouTube video dives into that specific aspect of the issue further:</p>

        <p>It is suggested that voter ID is necessary to protect the integrity of elections, to protect from people voting twice, undermining the idea of democracy as a whole, and to protect from impersonation or generally from people that are not supposed to vote, such as felons and undocumented immigrants<a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib7">(von Spakovsky)</a>. While there are not many reported cases of voter fraud, it is hard to know how many cases of voter fraud there actually are, since it’s a tricky crime to prosecute with not many ways to know beyond a reasonable doubt that the perpetrator actually committed the crime.</p>
