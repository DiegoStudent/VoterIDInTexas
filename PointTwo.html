    <h1>The Left on Voter ID</h1>
    <p>One of the arguments against Voter ID on the left is that it is a process that deprives Americans of their ability to vote in a way that may be arbitrary. The fact that states with voter ID laws don’t have to follow a specific set of guidelines for what kind of ID is allowed and what kind is not makes the laws seem at least somewhat illegitimate. </p>
    <p>The requirements usually boil down to a need for some kind of government issued photo ID but in fact, according to the ACLU, millions of Americans (11 percent or 21 million to be exact) do not have any form of a government issued photo ID <a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib3">(ACLU, "Oppose")</a>, and of that, according to Brennan Center, about 500,000 live more than 10 miles from the nearest “State ID issuing office open more than two days a week” and don’t have access to reliable transportation. Many of those people live in rural areas and don’t have access to any form of public transportation either.<a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib1">(Gaskins)</a> It has been said that up to 25 percent of African Americans may not have a “valid” ID <a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib3">(ACLU, "Oppose")</a> which has led to speculation that voter ID laws may be an attempt to suppress the black vote. </p>
    <p>Voter ID has been likened to the “poll tax” in this regard. The poll tax was a law that people had to pay to vote, it was made unconstitutional with the passing of the 24th amendment after it was found that minority votes were being suppressed because of it. In October of 2014, US district court judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos looked at “all of the evidence in totality”<a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib2">(Malewitz)</a>. After finding that minorities are less likely to have a valid form of ID under SB-14 (The bill in Texas requiring voter ID) it was ruled that the likeness of SB-14 to the poll tax made it unconstitutional.<a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib2">(Malewitz)</a></p>
    <p>While there are still several states with strict photo ID and strict non-photo ID requirements in place for voting strides have been made and are still being made to create a system that is seen as fair for everyone.</p>
