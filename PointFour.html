        <p>While voter ID is still a very contentious subject in American politics as a whole and more specifically Texas politics, there are some solutions that could be implemented. The left generally disagrees with any voter ID laws at all so the solution on their side would be to continue working towards removing laws that require some form of ID for voting. Likewise, the right generally has a similar all-or-noting type of ideology. They think there should be voter ID laws no matter what and tend not to acknowledge views from the other side or a need to find common ground.</p>
        <p>There are solutions that would benefit both sides, however. It has been suggested that perhaps forms of government ID, and if needed, underlying documents needed to obtain the ID, could be given to any citizen for free, and in stead of having to go to a DMV to claim the ID, it could be given out at post offices, which are in every community. Alternatively, a form of government ID could be automatically mailed to every American once they turn 18 <a class="in-text-citation" href="BIB.html#bib8">(Cohen)</a>.</p>
        <p>If none of that works, both sides could work to expand what is allowed to be counted as a valid form of ID and set a national standard. Ultimately this situation is not as divisive as it may seem, there can be common ground. The right just wants to make sure that were able to uphold election integrity and the left wants to make sure that no one gets left behind, or accidentally or intentionally disenfranchised, in the process. Working towards a bipartisan solution could alleviate tensions resulting from this issue and lessen political division as a whole, even if only slightly. Finding a solution that both sides can agree on, on a broader scale, benefits everyone.</p>
